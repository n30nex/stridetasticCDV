# STRIDEtastic

Stridetastic is an open-source monitoring and observability framework for Meshtastic® LoRa mesh networks. It was born as an undergraduate research project at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (IPre Program) to fill the gap between hobbyist tooling and more professional-grade monitoring, helping operators and administrators capture, inject, and visualize everything happening in their meshes.

## Research Background

- Meshtastic networks offer inexpensive, long-range connectivity but lack centralized observability. Existing tools expose either basic maps, message logs, or limited stats, leaving analysts blind to topology, latency, channel usage, or security anomalies. STRIDEtastic aims to fill this gap.


## Feature Overview

### Capture & Ingest
- Multi-interface sniffer connects to multiple MQTT brokers, physical serial radios, and network-connected nodes (TCP) simultaneously.
- Near real-time ingestion pipeline (Dispatcher → PacketHandler) that validates MeshPackets, **decrypts AES-CTR/PKI** payloads, maps nodes/channels/links, and normalizes protobuf payloads (NodeInfo, Position, Telemetry, NeighborInfo, RouteDiscovery, Routing).
- TimescaleDB hypertables persist packets, metrics, and historical states; raw **PCAP-NG** files are stored on disk and indexed for later analysis.
- UI-driven PCAP sessions with start/stop/download controls, automatic rotation, size limits, and per-frame annotations compatible with the bundled Wireshark Lua dissector (DLT 162).

### Active Publishing & Automation
- PublisherService crafts **legitimate** Text, NodeInfo, Position, Traceroute, and reachability probe packets with automatic channel hashing, hop-limit control, and AES/PKI encryption.
- **Reactive publishing engine** listens to configurable port triggers, enforces attempt windows, and targets per-interface publishers.
- Periodic jobs (Celery Beat + TimescaleDB state) execute recurring traceroutes or probes with status tracking and manual overrides.
- **Virtual nodes subsystem** provisions Curve25519 identities (public/private keys, NodeIDs, metadata) ready for legitimate packet injection.

### Security & Crypto Tooling
- AES-CTR decrypt/encrypt using per-channel PSKs with automatic normalization and channel-hash calculation.
- PKI Curve25519 + AES-CCM support for Meshtastic direct messages, including key generation, fingerprinting, and nonce derivation.
- Weak/duplicate key detection plus administrative views to audit channels, interfaces, and node secrets.

### Visualization & Analytics
- Next.js 15 dashboard (React 19 + Tailwind) with:
  - **Force-directed topology graph** synced with a Leaflet map.
  - Path analysis to inspect hops, RTTs, RSSI/SNR.
  - Node telemetry, latency, and position history panels.
  - Capture management, interface controls, and publishing workflows (manual/ reactive/ periodic) all from the browser.
- Grafana suite covering KPIs, geographic coverage, node health, packet flow, channel activity, routing, link quality, anomaly detection, SLA/compliance, and infrastructure capacity (Not fully developed).
- Wireshark dissector (`wireshark/meshtastic.lua`) that reads PCAP-NG comments to auto-select the right protobuf schema for each packet.

### Operations & Tooling
- Django-Ninja REST API with JWT auth exposes nodes, channels, links, captures, interfaces, metrics, graph data, and publisher endpoints.
- Celery workers manage long-running sniffers, capture writers, and publishing jobs; Redis acts as the broker/cache.
- Comprehensive documentation (`CLAUDE.md`, strategy decks, SQL cookbooks) plus pytest suites covering services, controllers, crypto, packet parsing, and seeds.
- Docker Compose stack wires TimescaleDB, API, Redis, Celery worker/beat, Next.js, and Grafana with optional serial device passthrough.

## Architecture at a Glance

```
compose.yaml
├── timescale_stridetastic     # PostgreSQL 17 + TimescaleDB
├── api_stridetastic           # Django API, Celery config, admin
├── redis_stridetastic         # Celery broker / caching layer
├── celery_stridetastic        # Worker (sniffer/publisher tasks)
├── celery_beat_stridetastic   # Scheduler for periodic jobs
├── web_stridetastic           # Next.js dashboard (pnpm build)
└── grafana_stridetastic       # Pre-provisioned dashboards
```

- **Capture Layer** – MQTT, Serial, TCP, and WebSocket interfaces feed the dispatcher.
- **Service Layer** – Sniffer, Publisher, Capture, PKI, and Virtual Node services coordinated by a singleton ServiceManager.
- **Data Layer** – TimescaleDB hypertables for packets/nodes/links + PCAP files on disk.
- **Presentation Layer** – Next.js dashboard for operations, Grafana for analytics, Django admin for power users, Wireshark for forensic drills.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1. Create your environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   vim .env
   ```
2. Bring up TimescaleDB first:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d timescale_stridetastic
   ```
3. Apply migrations and create an admin user:
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm api_stridetastic python /app/manage.py migrate
   docker compose run --rm api_stridetastic python /app/manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
4. (Optional) Seed default nodes/channels/interfaces:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d timescale_stridetastic
   docker compose run --rm api_stridetastic python /app/manage.py seeds
   ```
5. Launch the full stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
6. Visit the services:
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
   - API & Swagger: http://localhost:8000 / http://localhost:8000/api/docs
   - Django admin: http://localhost:8000/admin
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (default creds `admin:admin`)




## Using the Platform

1. **Onboard Interfaces** – Create MQTT, Serial, and/or TCP interfaces in the dashboard, enable them, and watch packets stream into TimescaleDB.
2. **Start Captures** – If you need to view the packets in Wireshark: Launch PCAP sessions from the UI for forensic investigations; download artifacts when complete and open them in Wireshark.
3. **Instrument Publishing** – For legitimate packet injection: configure virtual nodes and either fire single packets, enable reactive publishing (port-based), or schedule periodic traceroutes to profile paths.
4. **Explore Dashboards** – Use the Next.js console for operations and the Grafana pack for historical analysis, network topology graph, anomaly detection, SLA monitoring, and optimization insights.
